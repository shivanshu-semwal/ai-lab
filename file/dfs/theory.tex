Depth-first search is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or
graph data structures. The algorithm starts at the root node (selecting
some arbitrary node as the root node in the case of a graph) and
explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. So
the basic idea is to start from the root or any arbitrary node and mark
the node and move to the adjacent unmarked node and continue this loop
until there is no unmarked adjacent node. Then backtrack and check for
other unmarked nodes and traverse them. Finally, print the nodes in the
path.

\subsubsection*{Algorithm}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Mark the current node as visited and print the node.
    \item Traverse all the adjacent and unmarked nodes and call the recursive
          function with the index of the adjacent node.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Analysis:}

\begin{itemize}
    \item $V$ - number of vertices
    \item $E$ - number of edges
    \item \textbf{Time Complexity:} $O(V+E)$
    \item \textbf{Space Complexity:} $O(V)$
    \item Complete search
\end{itemize}
