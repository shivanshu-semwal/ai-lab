A depth-limited search algorithm is similar to depth-first search with a
predetermined limit. Depth-limited search can solve the drawback of the
infinite path in the Depth-first search. In this algorithm, the node at
the depth limit will treat as it has no successor nodes further.

Depth-limited search can be terminated with two Conditions of failure:

\begin{itemize}
      \item Standard failure value: It indicates that problem does not have any solution.
      \item Cutoff failure value: It defines no solution for the problem within a
            given depth limit.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Algorithm}

\begin{itemize}
      \item Determine the start node and the search depth.
      \item Check if the current node is the goal node. \\
            If not: Do nothing \\
            If yes:return
      \item Check if the current node is within the specified search depth \\
            If not: Do nothing \\
            If yes:Expand the node and save all of its successors in a stack.
      \item  Call DLS recursively for all nodes of the stack and go back to step 2.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Analysis}

\begin{itemize}
      \item $b$ - branching factor
      \item $d$ - depth of the graph
      \item $l$ - is the restricted depth
      \item \textbf{Time Complexity:} $O(b*l)$
      \item \textbf{Time Complexity:} $O(b*l)$
      \item Incomplete search
\end{itemize}
